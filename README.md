#NNMOVIE

 NNMOVIE is a movie archive collection. When you press the login button in the upper right corner, you can log in to our movie system and add movies to our system, delete movies from our system or update the movies in our system. So, do you have to log in? No!! When you press the movies button in the upper right corner, you can see all the movies saved in the system and have detailed information without logging into the system.
 
!!EXPLANATION!!

 Normally I needed to pull data via API using thymeleaf. But since I am new to the JAVA Web part, I could not pull the data using thymeleaf. In order to avoid any deficiencies in the project, I displayed the data directly from the database via the connection string. And the n-n module is not working for now. Missing parts will be completed soon. Finally, on some pages, the items in the header section are close to the logo. Normally, these items are positioned on the right, but this is how it perceives the css part a little late.
